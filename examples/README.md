# Examples
This folder contains examples for how `slurm-sweep` can be used. Each folder contains a `train.py` and a `config.yaml` file. The `submit.sh` file is generated by the package, you don't need to create this yourself. There's a basic commented example in this folder: `basic_config.yaml`.

## Overview
- `simple`: synthetic example, simulates model training without doing much. Good starting point.
- `scrna_seq_embedding`: compare data integration approaches for scRNA-seq data in terms of scIB metrics.
- `spatial_embedding`: compare spatial and non-spatial data integration approaches on a spatial transcriptomics dataset.
