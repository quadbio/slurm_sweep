# Comparing embeddings for spatial genomics data

This example is similar to the scRNA-seq embedding comparison example, only that we're using a datset of spatial transcriptomics data (seqFISH) from Lohoff et al (Nature Biotech 2022). We include a few spatial methods here, and we now have one config file per method, to tailor resources for each individual method.
